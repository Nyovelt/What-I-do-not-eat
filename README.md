## Canarypwn's First Food Law
如果一个东西很难吃，那么就不会流行 If something tastes bad, it won't be prevalent.

## Canarypwn's Second Food Law
当一个人年龄足够大的时候，他尝过大部分流行的食物。 As one grows up, one have tasted most of the prevalent food.

## Inference 1: If there is an unfamiliar food, it sucks.

推论一: 如果一个食物你没有见过，那么它大概率是不好吃的

Inference 1: If there is an unfamiliar food, it sucks.

**Proof:**

Let $P$ denotes the possibility of meeting a bad-tasted food which you havn't met before.

Then 
$P = P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{p(B)}$ where $A$ is the possibility of food which tastes bad, $B$ is the the possibility that you havn't met the food before.

P(B) is a constant, and by *Canarypwn's First Food Law*, $P(A)P(B|A)$ can be big, because bad food cannot be prevalent ($P(B|A)$). $\blacksquare$



> 在此注意: 为了避免错失美食，应该以适当的概率 $a$ 来尝试未出现过的食物。
> 
> Note: To hide your identity as the only smart person at the dinner table, one should explore the unfamiliar food with an ratio a, where $0 \le a \le 1$. Here I propose to use learning techniques, whether by deep learning or statistical learning, to adjust $a$.
